   *****  Crystal - a series of public-domain parsers *****  
   *****  and interpreters.                                            *****    

 The Crystal project is a set of small parsers and interpreters. 
Not many public-domain parsers and interpreters exist, and 
those that do tend to be fairly complex and hard to understand.   
This project aims to change that.  The code here is aimed first 
and foremost at being simple.   
 
This code is released to the public domain.  
"Share and enjoy..."   ;)
