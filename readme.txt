          *****  Crystal -  a public-domain C compiler  *****  

 Crystal is based on the sources for the public-domain Small-C 
compiler written by Ron Cain.  The sources from which Crystal 
is built were modified by Chris Lewis.  Many thanks to both Ron 
and Chris for their work on Small-C!  

 Although the original Small-C source was for a subset of the 
C language, Crystal is aimed at eventually becoming a compiler 
for the full C language.  

 At present, the source only has code-generators for old machines 
(e.g. the VAX).  A new codefile will soon be started in order 
for the compiler to run on modern machines.  

This code is released to the public domain.  
"Share and enjoy..."   ;)
